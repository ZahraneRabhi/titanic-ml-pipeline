# Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project

- This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and modeling the famous Titanic dataset to extract insights and build a linear binary predictive model based on Logistic Regression Algorithm.
- lowkey into AI/ML these days so this should be a good(but basic) start right?
